  ### Usage:
  As a user of the Widget Wizard application:
    - When I enter the [homepage](https://tranquil-tor-75275-57652b10176e.herokuapp.com/) I am presented with a user friendly interface, with a nicely styled logo and pallete, an instruction on how to create my custom dashboard, a 'Login/Sign Up' button, a default widget "Astronomy Picture of the Day" and a link to access information about the developers.
    - When I click on the 'Login/Sign Up' button, I am presented with a card to login if I have already signed up, or to sign up if I haven't signed up yet. To sign up I need to input my e-mail, username and password. To login all I need to enter is the created username and password. Then I press submit and it will redirect me to the dashboard page.
    - When I login for the first time I am presented with an empty dashboard and a 'Add Widget' button for a drop-down menu tha displays a diverse list of widgets that I can click to add to my dashboard.
    - When I select a widget it will be displayed on my dashboard and I can click on 'Drag from here' to drag it and position the widget anywhere I would like to within the dashboard borders.
    - When I add more widgets to my dashboard, I am allowed to add as many widgets as I would like to, but each widget can be added only once and the data provided can be reloaded or updated.
    - When I no longer want a widget on my dashboard I can click the 'Delete' button in its card to delete it.
    - When I am in my dashboard page I can click the Logout button if desired to sign out.
